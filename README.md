# ESP32 Binary Clock
Goal: create a system that retrieves the time from wi-fi and/or GPS and display it by using on/off LEDS to represent 1s and 0s. GPS version displays coordinates as well. Eventually further versions will have custom PCBs, however I need to learn PCB design/KiCad first. 

## Materials List:
- ESP32 (needs 13 GPIO pins)
- Female pin headers (ESP --> PCB connection)
- Male pin headers (
- LEDs (x13, 5mm)
- ElectroCookie Solderable Breadboard (1/2 size)
- PCB protoboard (smaller than ElectroCookie one)
- 220 ohm resistors (x13)
- Electrical wire and/or breadboard wires

Strongly Recommended: 
Have a test rig setup with basic Arduino IDE code that blinks an LED. This saved me a LOT of time when trying to figure out which connection(s) I initially soldered incorrectly.
